                        Project:-todo-list
----------------------------------Description---------------------------------------------

    This project is  simple and powerful application for managing tasks and staying organized.This todo application is simple way  for "adding","reading" tasks.This project is an excellent way to practice coding skills and provide more learning oppertunities.Working on this project not only reinforces fundamental concepts but also presents challenging problem-solving opportunities along the way.It enhance my knowlege and give me strong understanding of core aspects of javascript language.
--------------------------------------Implementation---------------------------------------  
The project is under the hat of" todo-list" directory.We have two files till now to complete the desired functionality
   "todo.js"
   "tasks.txt"
"tasks.txt"consists all the tasks  either we have already write directly in text file or write from the command line trough the "command line arguments".
"todo.js" is the heart of the functionality.we write all the functions till now to complete the functionality through the file system we used to read, write or add tasks.  

-----------------------------------Features-------------------------------------
  
    *Reading Tasks:  The list of tasks is displayed to the console if there will be no new added task .For implementing this features we can type the command on command-line
    node <filename>.It will read the text file .It also count the tasks while reading and print it to console by typing in the shell or terminal for example:-
    node todo.js
    3 tasks to do:
    [ ]Go to beach
    [ ]Eat ice-cream
    [ ]Have some fun
    *Add Tasks: We can add task or write tasks to the todo-list by adding task from the command line by simply <adding> task name .One impoertant feature while writing is it also print the message and the number of the task it is is gonna to be added to the text file.
    meassges printed to the console like this after typing the command:
    $ node todo.js add "swimming"
    "swimming" added (5 task to do:)

    ---------------------------------Technologies-----------------------------------------

      *Used plain javascript .
      *Version Control: Use Git for version control to track changes and collaborate with others. 
      *VScode editor


----------------------------Challenges and Learning Opportunities----------------------

      *Learning plain JavaScript.
      *Working with the file syestem to read,write and update tasks number.
